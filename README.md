App Description

The Daily Expense App is a personal finance tool that helps users track their daily spending patterns. It allows for the entry of expense amounts and descriptions, categorized via a Spinner containing options like Office Supplies, Travel, and Client Meetings. Users can specify the payment mode (Cash or Online) using Radio Buttons. All recorded expenses are dynamically displayed in a ListView or CardView for easy review. To facilitate professional communication, the app includes direct shortcuts to contact an accountant or expense manager through phone, SMS, or email, with a mandatory Confirmation Dialog before executing any telephony task.
